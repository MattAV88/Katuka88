    <p>TYPES OF ANOMALY
        INCOMPLETENESS, INCONSISTENCY 
        
        DISTRIBUTION ANOMALY
        SITUATION 1: READING OFF WHEN THE CUMMULATIVE IS 0%
        SITUATION 2: READING OFF WHEN THE CUMMULATIVE IS 100%

        Award process normal
        Types of anomaly (data irregularity and distribution irregularity)
        Data: When the % capture is not uniform
        Things to look out for: performance on paper components differ. If a person is good in paper 1, it does not necessarily mean the person must be equally good in papers 2 and 3. Investigation should be carried out on the symmetrical of % capture at total raw and scaled total. Why are some data distorted? How are CA’s computed?
        
        Process Irregularity <br>
        When we have 100% cumulative
        When we have 0% cumulative
        When the distribution is not normal (must not be normal but it is expected not to be clustered around certain scores. (malpractice, difficulty of test paper, strong discrimination of test paper) Note that iit is not the candidature per se that determines the effectiveness of the distribution. What do that are the things highlighted above.  When the statistical contribution fails to give the desired critical grades, the raws are adjusted 
        (Terms of Operation: realisation of reasoned or well thought out critical grades takes prominence over the process. When the desired critical grades cannot be obtained using the process, the raw scores are adjusted such that the paper(s) with declined performance will e reduced or those with relatively increased performance to be increased, depending on the circumstance 2 the paper most liable to give untrue score) Examples are done to exemplify what is taught.

        The award process proper
            From data capturing to computation 
        Expectations
            Generalizability: 
            The % captures for acceptable generalization should can range from 30% of the population if in each tenth of the population is a high probability of obtaining similar or same distribution to or as the whole sample. 
            Because the missing scores for candidates with incomplete scores are accorded the value 0, the test takers with incomplete scores should not constitute up to 95% of the entries used for the award statistics. (Relative deficiency of a paper component, in comparison to the gradable entries, should be ≥95%) 
            Stating the assumptions – Performance of candidates across the paper components is similar.
